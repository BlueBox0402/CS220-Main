/// Modify the function `safeSub` in such a way that the function takes in two
/// 32-bit integers a and b, and returns "a - b" as output.
///   - In normal cases, it should return the resulting number.
///   - In error cases, i.e., overflow cases, it should simply return 0. Your
///     function should have the type: "int -> int -> int".
